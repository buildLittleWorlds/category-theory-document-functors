    "In this tutorial, we meet **Lorren Dray** and encounter the problem that motivated her life's work: the **multiple classification problem**.\n",

    "### The Year 918 Observation\n",
    "\n",
    "Working as a junior cataloger at the Capital Archives, Dray noticed something puzzling. The same document seemed to belong to multiple categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A boundary survey report was simultaneously:\n",
    "  - A geographic record (in the location index)\n",
    "  - A personnel document (in the author index)\n",
    "  - A technical manual (in the methodology index)\n",
    "  - A historical source (in the date registry)\n",
    "\n",
    "Which category was \"correct\"? None of them — and all of them. The document's identity depended on *how you accessed it*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the multiple classification problem\n",
    "2. See how documents yield different observations through different access methods\n",
    "3. Begin thinking about documents as *functions* that respond to inquiry\n",
